\description{
Send events to Google Analytics.
If an event happens in your script, use this function to send the event to Google Analytics.
An event has a category, an action and optionally a label and a value can be set for the event. \cr
Possible use cases of this are sending when a user loads your package, sending when a user does some action on your shiny application,
storing when a user uses your R webservice, keeping information on the status of a long-running process, sending and error message ...\cr

Events can be viewed in the Google Analytics > Behaviour > Events tab or in the Real-Time part of Google Analytics.
